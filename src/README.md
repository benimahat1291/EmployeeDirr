# Employee Directory

## Overview

An employee Directory that lists employee information and can sort data by feild or by search bar filter. 

## Functionality

Uses Api from "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20&?nat=us" to retrive random user information. Information is displayed on page. Each employee has an image, name, phonenumber, email, and age. If the header of the feild is selected employee list is ordered in ascending alphabetical or numerical order, and if clicked again employees are shown in desending order. If something is typed in the search bar, the name feild will be filtered to only include names that have the same characters as the search feild. 

## Business Context

Many application use tables that have these functionality. It is importand to be able to dynamicly view data in an era where there is so much of it. This will be a powerfull skill in my coding arsenal. 

## Challenges
As this is my first react app it was very hard learning the flow of how components communicated with each other. Using useState and useEffect were something that I needed to get used to before I could figure out how to do any of my other functions. It was also hard to grasp array mapping, sort and filter as they were all concepts that I have not looked at in along time. All in all I learned alot, and feel ready to tackle more react projects.
